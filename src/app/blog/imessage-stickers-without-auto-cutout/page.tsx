        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          You long-press a meme in Photos. You tap Add Sticker. iOS does its little subject-detection
          animation. The result drops the punchline. The reaction face is gone. The text overlay is
          gone. The hands holding the sign are gone. What you wanted to send was the whole image —
          what you got is a floating head against transparent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          This is not a bug. Apple&apos;s <strong>Add Sticker</strong> always runs the cutout, and
          there is <strong>no setting to turn it off</strong>. Here&apos;s why iOS does it, why
          third-party apps can&apos;t turn it off either, and the path that actually keeps the full
          image: a sticker pack app that imports stickers without going anywhere near the system
          cutout pipeline.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          What Apple&apos;s Add Sticker actually does
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When you tap Add Sticker on a photo (iOS 17 and later), iOS runs the image through the{" "}
          <strong>Vision framework</strong> — Apple&apos;s on-device computer-vision library. Vision
          looks for what it thinks is the foreground subject, generates a mask, and crops everything
          else away. The result is saved as a new system sticker with a transparent background.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For a portrait, a pet, a single object on a plain background, this works well. The
          Vision model has been trained on millions of subject-isolation tasks and the resulting
          sticker usually looks clean.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For a meme, this is destructive. The cutout assumes <strong>one</strong> subject and{" "}
          <strong>no</strong> meaningful background. Memes almost always violate both assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Text overlays get masked away.</strong> The captioned line at the top or bottom
            of an image macro is, to Vision, background. It gets removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hands and props get cut off.</strong> A reaction image where someone holds a
            sign, points at the camera, or holds an object — Vision often decides the hand is part
            of the background and slices it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context disappears.</strong> A screenshot where the meaning is in the whole
            frame (a tweet, a chat bubble layout, a UI element) is reduced to whatever Vision
            decided was the most prominent shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two-subject memes break.</strong> Drake meme, distracted-boyfriend, expanding-brain —
            Vision picks one subject and masks the other. The joke depends on having both.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Why you can&apos;t disable it
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          There&apos;s no setting in Settings → Messages, no toggle in Photos, no developer
          entitlement. The cutout is hard-wired into the Add Sticker flow. Apple&apos;s product
          decision is that <em>system stickers should be cutouts</em>; the whole sticker drawer is
          designed around transparent-background subjects that can sit on top of anyone&apos;s
          message bubble.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Third-party apps can&apos;t patch this for you. The Vision call happens inside Apple&apos;s
          private Stickers extension; the public Messages framework gives sticker-pack apps a
          separate pipeline (MSStickerBrowserView) that doesn&apos;t touch Vision at all. Two
          parallel sticker systems, sharing the same iMessage drawer, with very different policies
          on what an &quot;image&quot; means.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          So if you want a whole-image sticker in iMessage, the answer isn&apos;t to fight Add
          Sticker. It&apos;s to use the other pipeline.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          The alternative: a sticker pack with the raw image
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Sticker-pack apps ship as iMessage extensions that register their own grid in the iMessage
          app drawer. They use the public <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">MSSticker</code>{" "}
          API, which takes a raw image file and registers it as a sticker. No Vision call. No
          subject detection. No automatic cropping. Whatever you put in is what your friends see.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          MemePouch is that pipeline, specifically tuned for memes. You import a photo, GIF, short
          video, or Live Photo; the app stores the full frame; the iMessage extension exposes the
          library in your sticker drawer. There are two real constraints to be aware of, both
          inherited from the underlying APIs:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Static stickers have a 500 KB cap</strong> because MSSticker enforces it. MemePouch
            auto-compresses larger photos to fit; visible quality loss is rare for typical meme
            resolutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GIF stickers route through Messages attachments instead</strong>, which means they
            don&apos;t have the 500 KB cap (up to ~10 MB) but they send as their own full-quality
            bubble rather than sticking onto an existing message bubble. The trade-off is deliberate —
            you get high-fidelity animated stickers at the cost of the bubble-overlay behaviour.
          </li>
        </ul>

          after import if you turn on Auto-Delete in Settings — useful if you collect memes off the
          web and don&apos;t want them cluttering Photos.

          When Apple&apos;s cutout is the right answer

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          To be fair to the Vision team — for the things it&apos;s designed for, Add Sticker is
          excellent. A photo of your dog. A clean portrait. A single object you photographed
          against a wall. Anywhere the &quot;subject on transparent background&quot; aesthetic is
          actually what you want, the built-in tool is fast, free, and works without installing
          anything. MemePouch isn&apos;t trying to replace it; it&apos;s the answer for the other
          half of the sticker use-case — where you want the image, not a cutout of part of it.

              Can I disable Apple&apos;s auto-cutout?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              No. There is no toggle in Settings, Photos, or Messages. The Vision-framework cutout
              is hard-wired into Apple&apos;s Add Sticker flow. The only way to get a whole-image
              iMessage sticker is to use a different pipeline — a third-party sticker pack app like
              MemePouch.

              Why doesn&apos;t Apple expose a setting?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              The whole system stickers drawer is designed around transparent-subject stickers that
              can be dragged onto someone&apos;s message bubble. A whole-image sticker would look
              wrong in that drawer — a rectangle floating on top of another rectangle. Apple&apos;s
              design call is to keep the system drawer cutout-only; whole-image stickers live in
              third-party sticker apps&apos; own drawers.

              Does MemePouch use any AI / Vision processing on import?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              No. The import path is: read the file → if it&apos;s over the MSSticker 500 KB cap,
              compress (preserving aspect ratio and frame) → write to the app&apos;s on-device
              library. No subject detection, no upscaling, no cloud calls.

              Static stickers — yes. They&apos;re real <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">MSSticker</code>{" "}
              objects and you long-press &amp; drag them onto another person&apos;s message exactly
              the way you would an Apple cutout sticker. Animated GIF stickers route through
              Messages attachments and send as their own bubble rather than sticking onto an
              existing one — the trade for not being clamped to 500 KB.

              A few things. Animated GIF stickers up to 10 seconds (Apple&apos;s system stickers
              only animate Live-Photo-derived cutouts). Bulk import. A separate library that
              doesn&apos;t pollute the iOS system stickers drawer. Drag-import of third-party
              stickers received in chat (also broken in Apple&apos;s flow). And — the topic of
              this post — keeping the full frame.
