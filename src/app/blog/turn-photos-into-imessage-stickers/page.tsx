          How to turn photos into iMessage stickers in 2026
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          MemePouch is a free-to-try iPhone app (iOS 16+) that turns your photos, GIFs, and short
          videos into reusable iMessage stickers, and lets you save stickers other people send you
          in iMessage by dragging them into your library. It&apos;s free to try; a
          one-time unlock removes the cap.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This guide covers everything you need to start using your own face, your dog, a frame
          from your favorite movie, or that animated reaction you cannot stop laughing at as a
          custom iMessage sticker — and to grab the best ones your friends send you so you never
          have to ask &quot;where did you get that?&quot; again.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Why custom iMessage stickers?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Apple&apos;s built-in sticker drawer in iOS 17 lets you make stickers from photos by
          tapping subjects in your library, but it stops there. It cannot trim a video into an
          animated GIF sticker, it cannot pull a sticker out of a chat someone sent you, and it
          cannot keep your sticker library separate from your real camera roll. A dedicated
          sticker maker app fills those gaps. MemePouch is built specifically around the three
          rules iMessage stickers actually have to follow — 500 KB per sticker, PNG/JPEG/GIF
          only, and the iMessage app drawer — so anything you import is guaranteed to work the
          moment you open Messages.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Step 1 — Install MemePouch
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Get MemePouch from the App Store. The first time you open it, iOS will ask for read
          access to Photos so you can pick what to import. There are no accounts and no sign-up.
          Your sticker library stays on your iPhone, in a sandboxed App Group container shared
          between the main app and the iMessage extension — so the stickers you create on the
          home screen show up immediately when you open the iMessage app drawer.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Step 2 — Import your first sticker
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          MemePouch gives you four ways to bring images into your library, depending on where
          the source lives:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>From Photos:</strong> tap &quot;Import from Photos&quot; on the home screen,
            pick up to 30 images or GIFs at once, and they&apos;re added to your library. HEIC
            photos taken on your iPhone are decoded and re-encoded into a sticker-compatible
            format (PNG when possible, JPEG if the PNG would exceed iMessage&apos;s 500 KB
            cap).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From a video:</strong> tap &quot;Turn a video into a GIF&quot;, pick a clip
            from your library, trim up to 10 seconds, and MemePouch saves it as an animated GIF
            sticker. GIF stickers ship as full-quality Messages attachments (no 500 KB cap) — you
            get sharper, longer clips than Apple&apos;s MSSticker route allows. Trade-off: GIF
            stickers send as their own message bubble, not stuck onto someone&apos;s existing
            bubble like a static sticker.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From the clipboard:</strong> copy an image in Safari, Twitter/X, or any
            other app, then come back to MemePouch and tap &quot;Paste from Clipboard&quot;.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From the share sheet:</strong> in any other app showing an image, tap the
            share button and choose MemePouch. The image is imported in the background and
            ready next time you open Messages.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Step 3 — Send your stickers in iMessage
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Open any chat in Messages, tap the apps icon to the left of the text field, and select
          MemePouch. Your library appears as a grid. Tap a sticker to drop it in the message
          field, or long-press and drag it onto a specific chat bubble to peel-and-place it as a
          reaction. The iMessage extension and the main app share the same on-device library
          via an App Group, and the extension automatically reloads when the manifest changes,
          so anything you import shows up the next time you open the drawer.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          How to save stickers other people send you
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is the part most people don&apos;t realize is even possible. iOS 17+ shows a Save
          to Stickers button in the Emoji Details view (long-press the sticker, scroll the menu),
          but for third-party stickers the save action hangs — Apple&apos;s system sticker daemon
          drops the connection and the sticker never reaches your iOS sticker drawer. The
          reliable alternative is the drag-and-drop gesture into a sticker app&apos;s iMessage
          extension. Two ways:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Two-finger drag (MemePouch not open yet).</strong> Long-press the sticker
            with one finger, keep holding. With another finger, tap the apps icon at the bottom
            of the screen and open MemePouch from the iMessage app drawer. Drag the sticker onto
            MemePouch&apos;s grid and release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-finger drag (MemePouch already open).</strong> If MemePouch is already
            visible in the iMessage drawer below the chat, you don&apos;t need a second finger —
            long-press the sticker and drag it straight down onto the grid.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Both methods land the sticker in your own library, animation intact, ready to send back
          to anyone. Tapping the sticker in MemePouch&apos;s grid auto-collapses the extension
          back to the chat, so you can send it immediately.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Apple&apos;s MSSticker spec caps static stickers (PNG / JPEG) at <strong>500 KB</strong>{" "}
          — MemePouch auto-compresses by progressively reducing dimensions and JPEG quality until
          the file fits. For GIFs, MemePouch ships them as Messages attachments instead of
          MSStickers, so they&apos;re not subject to the 500 KB cap and can be up to{" "}
          <strong>10 MB</strong> and <strong>10 seconds</strong>. Shorter clips (around 3 seconds)
          still feel snappiest in chat and loop most naturally, but longer is supported.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Keep your camera roll clean
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          One of the small reasons a dedicated sticker app exists at all is that the photos you
          turn into stickers usually aren&apos;t photos you want polluting your real camera
          roll. MemePouch has an opt-in <strong>Auto-Delete</strong> setting: after a successful
          import, iOS prompts you (with its standard confirmation dialog) to move the original
          to your Recently Deleted album. The result is a clean Photos library and a separate,
          focused sticker collection that doesn&apos;t get mixed up with vacation pictures.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The library is stored locally on your iPhone, and syncs through your own iCloud if
          you leave that switched on. There are no accounts, and no server of ours ever holds
          your stickers. The app sends anonymous usage analytics — which features get used,
          never the stickers themselves.
