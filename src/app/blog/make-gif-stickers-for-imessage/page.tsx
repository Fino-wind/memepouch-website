          How to make GIF stickers for iMessage from any video or Live Photo
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8">Last updated 2026-05-14 · iOS 16+</p>

        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          iMessage doesn&apos;t have a built-in way to turn an arbitrary video into a GIF sticker. iOS
          17 added &quot;Live Stickers&quot; from Live Photos, but it auto-cuts out the subject (often
          wrong), heavily compresses the result so quality collapses, and won&apos;t touch a regular
          video. If you want a sharp, full-image GIF sticker from <em>any</em> short clip — a
          screen recording, a movie clip, a Live Photo, a downloaded video — you need a
          dedicated app.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>MemePouch makes this a 30-second job.</strong> Pick a source, trim up to 10
          seconds, save. The GIF goes straight into your iMessage sticker library and sends as a
          high-quality attachment to any chat. It&apos;s free to try; a one-time
          unlock gets unlimited stickers.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">Step-by-step</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-slate-900">1. Pick your source</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          From the MemePouch home screen, tap either:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Turn a video into a GIF</strong> — pick any video from your Photos library.
            Movie clips, screen recordings, downloaded videos all work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Turn a Live Photo into a GIF</strong> — pick a Live Photo. MemePouch uses the
            motion video baked into the Live Photo and skips the cutout step.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-slate-900">2. Trim up to 10 seconds</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You&apos;ll land in a trim view with the clip playing on a loop. Drag the start and end
          handles to pick the segment you want. The default trim is 3 seconds — for stickers
          that&apos;s the sweet spot because:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>3-second GIFs load instantly in iMessage</li>
          <li>The file size stays small, so they send fast even on slow connections</li>
          <li>Loops feel natural — a 3-second reaction loops cleanly forever</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You can stretch it to 10 seconds for longer reactions or in-jokes that need setup. Past
          that, MemePouch won&apos;t let you — the encoding pipeline is tuned for sticker-sized GIFs,
          not long video.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-slate-900">3. Save as GIF sticker</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Tap <strong>Create GIF Sticker</strong>. MemePouch encodes the GIF at a quality preset
          that stays sharp without bloating the file. It&apos;s added to your sticker library
          alongside any static stickers you have.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-slate-900">4. Send it from iMessage</h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Open any iMessage chat. In the iMessage app drawer next to the keyboard, tap the
          MemePouch icon — your sticker library appears. Use the filter at the top of the grid
          to show only GIFs if you have a lot of stickers. Tap the GIF you want, and the
          keyboard collapses back to the chat with the GIF already in your message bar. Hit
          send.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Why GIF stickers send as attachments instead of bubble stickers
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Apple&apos;s MSSticker API — the one that lets a sticker attach onto someone&apos;s message
          bubble — caps each sticker file at <strong>500 KB</strong>. A 3-second, 480-pixel GIF
          with reasonable framerate easily blows past 500 KB. To stay under the cap, you have to
          drop resolution or framerate dramatically, and the result is a smeary, jerky GIF — not
          worth sending.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          MemePouch makes the opposite trade. GIF stickers send through Apple&apos;s
          <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 rounded mx-1">insertAttachment</code> path
          instead, which doesn&apos;t have the 500 KB cap. The GIF lands in the conversation at the
          quality you actually want. The price: it sends as its own bubble in the chat — it
          doesn&apos;t stick onto someone&apos;s existing message bubble like a static sticker can. For
          GIFs, the quality is worth the trade.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Static stickers (PNG/JPEG) still use MSSticker, so they can still attach to bubbles. You
          get the right behavior for each kind automatically.
        </p>

          Other things worth knowing
        </h2>
        <ul className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Whole image, no auto-cutout.</strong> Unlike iOS Live Stickers, MemePouch
            doesn&apos;t try to remove the background. The whole frame is the sticker — useful for
            anything where the background or text is part of the joke. See the{" "}

            <strong>Save GIF stickers friends send you.</strong> If a friend sent you a GIF
            sticker in iMessage and you want to reuse it, long-press it with one finger and use
            another finger to swipe up the iMessage app drawer, then drop it onto MemePouch.
            MemePouch keeps the animation intact. See the{" "}

            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Filter by GIFs.</strong> Both the main app and the iMessage extension have a
            built-in filter at the top of the grid — All / Images / GIFs. Useful once your
            library grows.

              No — GIFs send as full-quality attachments, not as MSSticker objects. Static
              stickers do attach to bubbles. The trade is conscious: GIFs send sharp instead of
              smeared down by aggressive compression.
