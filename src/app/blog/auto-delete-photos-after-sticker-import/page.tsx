        Auto-delete original photos after sticker import

      <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8 not-prose">Last updated 2026-05-20 · iOS 16+</p>

      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Heavy meme users hit the same wall: after a few months of saving funny screenshots to
        Photos so a sticker app can find them, the camera roll is a junk drawer. Family photos
        sit between cropped Twitter reactions and out-of-context screenshots of reaction GIFs.
        MemePouch&apos;s optional <strong>Auto-delete originals after import</strong> setting
        fixes this by deleting each meme from Photos the moment it&apos;s safely a sticker.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Why it exists
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Stickers are the destination, not the source. Once a meme is a sticker in MemePouch&apos;s
        library, the original photo has served its purpose — keeping it in Photos is pure
        clutter unless you have a separate reason to. The setting is off by default (we
        don&apos;t want to surprise anyone), but for users who&apos;ve already invested in a
        50–200 sticker library, it&apos;s usually the first thing they enable.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        How to enable it
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Open MemePouch → tap the gear icon → flip <strong>Auto-delete originals after
        import</strong> on. The next time you import via the PhotosPicker, iOS shows a
        confirmation sheet asking permission to delete the source photo(s). Tap Delete and
        the originals move to Recently Deleted.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        It&apos;s a soft delete — Recently Deleted holds 30 days
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        MemePouch uses the standard{" "}
        <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 rounded">PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets</code>{" "}
        API. Photos are <em>not</em> hard-deleted — they go to Photos → Albums → Recently
        Deleted and stay there 30 days. Changed your mind? Open Recently Deleted, tap Recover,
        the photo&apos;s back in your library. This is the same behavior as deleting a photo
        from Photos manually. It is impossible for MemePouch (or any third-party app) to
        bypass that grace period.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        What it deletes, what it doesn&apos;t
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Only photos that came through the <strong>PhotosPicker</strong> (the
        &quot;Import from Photos&quot; / &quot;Turn a Live Photo into a GIF&quot; / &quot;Turn
        a video into a GIF&quot; flows) are eligible. The reason: MemePouch only has a delete
        handle for assets it pulled from Photos. Images you brought in via clipboard paste,
        the Share Sheet, drag-and-drop from another app, or drag-import from iMessage{" "}
        <strong>were never in Photos to begin with</strong> — there&apos;s nothing to delete.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Assets you don&apos;t own — typically iCloud Shared Library items added by someone
        else — are correctly skipped by iOS&apos;s permission layer; you&apos;ll see a
        &quot;no permission&quot; toast and the original is untouched.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        The toast feedback after every import
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        After each import you get a toast saying what happened to the source: <em>deleted</em>{" "}
        (you confirmed), <em>cancelled</em> (you tapped Don&apos;t Allow on the iOS prompt),{" "}
        <em>no permission</em> (the asset wasn&apos;t deletable), or <em>off</em> (the setting
        isn&apos;t enabled). No silent behavior — you always know exactly what state your
        Photos library is in.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        iCloud Photos
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        If iCloud Photos is on, the delete propagates to all your Apple devices and to iCloud
        itself. Apple&apos;s own 30-day grace period covers the iCloud copy too — the photo
        stays in Recently Deleted on every device until that window closes.
