        How to organize your iMessage sticker library in MemePouch
      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8 not-prose">Last updated 2026-05-20 · iOS 16+</p>

      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        The moment a sticker library crosses 20 or 30 items, &quot;just scroll until you find it&quot;
        stops being a strategy. MemePouch was built around the idea that a sticker keyboard should
        feel like a chat-speed tool — pull up the right reaction in under a second. This post
        walks through the library features that get you there: smart sorting that floats your
        most-used stickers to the top on its own, pinning your go-to stickers to the front,
        filtering, previewing, reordering, and deduplicating.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Smart sorting — the stickers you use most rise to the top
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Before you touch a single setting, MemePouch is already organizing for you. The library
        sorts itself by <strong>how often you actually use each sticker</strong> — the ones you
        send the most rise to the top automatically, so your go-to reactions stay within
        thumb&apos;s reach. Old favorites you haven&apos;t sent in weeks slowly fade down without
        disappearing. The same order shows up in both the main app and the iMessage drawer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Just imported something new? It stays parked at the top for the first 24 hours so
        it&apos;s easy to find while it&apos;s fresh, then it settles into the usage-based order
        like everything else. It all happens invisibly — there&apos;s no setting to fiddle with
        and no &quot;frequently used&quot; tab to switch into. The two tools below let you take
        manual control on top of this: pin a handful of favorites to the very front, and
        drag-reorder to break ties exactly how you like.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Pin your go-to stickers to the top
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        You probably reach for the same handful of reactions over and over. Long-press a sticker
        and tap <strong>Pin to Top</strong> — it jumps above the rest of the grid and gets a small
        pin badge so you can spot it at a glance. Pinned stickers stay put at the front whether
        you&apos;re in the main app or the iMessage drawer, so your most-used reactions are always
        the first thing you see.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Pinned more than one? Drag them around to set the exact order you want — your favorite
        in slot one, the runner-up next to it. The order you set sticks across launches and across
        both surfaces. To unpin, long-press again and tap <strong>Unpin</strong>; the sticker drops
        back into the regular library below.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Filter: All / Images / GIF
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        A segmented control sits at the top of the library — three pills: <strong>All</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Images</strong>, <strong>GIF</strong>. The same control appears in the iMessage
        extension drawer, so when you&apos;re typing a reply and want a GIF reaction, one tap
        scopes the grid to animated stickers and you can pick without scrolling past static ones.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Animated stickers also carry a small <strong>GIF</strong> badge in the bottom-right of
        each card — a visual confirm that the sticker will animate when sent, not just sit as a
        still frame.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Preview before you send
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Tap the play button on a GIF card to open a full-screen looping preview powered by a
        custom <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 rounded">CGImageSource</code>-based
        renderer. Use it to check that the loop seam is clean — Smart loop usually nails it, but
        for the rare clip where the seam shows, you can spot it before sending instead of after.
        Tap anywhere to dismiss.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Long-press to drag and reorder
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Long-press any sticker and drag it onto another to swap positions. The original card
        dims to 40% opacity during the drag so you know what you&apos;re moving. The new order
        is persisted to the App Group container and used by both the main app and the iMessage
        extension drawer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Practical workflow: pin your top three or four reactions so they always sit at the front,
        then drag-reorder the pinned set into the exact order you want. Everything else stays in
        the auto-sorted grid below, one swipe away.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Duplicate prevention (SHA-256 content hash)
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Every import runs through an SHA-256 hash of the underlying bytes. If the hash matches
        a sticker already in your library, the import is rejected with a friendly{" "}
        <em>&quot;This sticker is already in your library&quot;</em> error. So you can
        confidently slam-paste from the clipboard, re-share the same meme from a chat, or
        import the same Live Photo twice — MemePouch quietly drops the dupe and your library
        stays clean.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Note: the check is on raw byte equality. If a meme is re-encoded by another app
        (different JPEG quality, different metadata), the hash will differ and you&apos;ll get
        a legitimate second copy. This is the right behavior — different bytes can mean
        different quality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        Why no folders or packs?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        MemePouch is deliberately library-first: one grid, no named packs, no folders. The
        design assumption is that your stickers are your private reaction set for iMessage —
        not curated collections you&apos;re publishing to friends or to a community feed. If
        you need pack-style organization (name a pack, group stickers into it, share the pack
        as a unit), use a cross-platform sticker app like Sticker Maker Studio — it&apos;s built
        for that workflow. See the{" "}
