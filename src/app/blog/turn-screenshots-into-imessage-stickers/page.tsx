          If you&apos;ve tried iOS 17&apos;s &quot;long-press to lift subject&quot; trick on a meme screenshot,
          you already know the problem: Apple&apos;s sticker maker tries to be smart and cuts out
          what <em>it</em> thinks is the subject. Half the time, the result is wrong — the punchline
          text is gone, a hand is sliced off, the half of the panel that makes the joke land is
          missing. There&apos;s no setting to turn the cutout off. It&apos;s the only path Apple gives you.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Why Apple&apos;s long-press cutout breaks memes
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          iOS 16 added &quot;lift subject from background,&quot; and iOS 17 extended it into a Stickers
          drawer. On the surface it&apos;s amazing — on-device ML, instant, no editing app required.
          In practice, here&apos;s where it falls apart:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Text overlays.</strong> Subject detection often treats meme caption text as
            &quot;not part of the subject&quot; and clips it out. The image is half the joke; the text is the
            other half.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple subjects.</strong> A reaction screenshot with two people, or a person
            and a sign, picks one. The one Apple chooses is rarely the one you wanted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UI chrome.</strong> A funny iMessage exchange screenshot includes bubbles,
            timestamps, names — context that makes the screenshot funny. Apple sees it as
            background and removes it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Busy or low-contrast backgrounds.</strong> Detection edges go ragged. You get
            jagged outlines that look like a poorly cut-out PNG from 2005.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No way to disable it.</strong> There is no toggle for &quot;just keep the whole
            image, please.&quot; You either use the cutout or you don&apos;t make a sticker.
          </li>
        </ul>

          The MemePouch approach: full image, every time
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          MemePouch was built around this specific frustration. Screenshots imported into MemePouch
          stay whole — exactly the rectangle you screenshotted, with whatever text, UI, multiple
          subjects, or backgrounds are in it. That&apos;s the entire promise. It&apos;s not a fancier
          cutout. It&apos;s the opposite — <strong>no cutout</strong>.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-slate-900">Step-by-step</h3>
        <ol className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3">
          <li>
            Take the screenshot you want. Keep the whole frame — you don&apos;t need to crop before
            importing, and you definitely don&apos;t need Apple&apos;s subject detection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open <strong>MemePouch</strong>. Tap <em>Import from Photos</em>. Select the
            screenshot. It&apos;s added to your library as-is.
          </li>
          <li>
            In any iMessage chat, tap the <strong>MemePouch icon in the app drawer</strong> next to
            the keyboard. Your screenshot sticker is right there. Tap it to send.
          </li>
          <li>
            Static screenshot stickers can also be <strong>dragged onto a message bubble</strong> —
            same &quot;sticker on top of a message&quot; feel as Apple&apos;s system stickers.

          When you actually want Apple&apos;s cutout
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          To be fair: if you&apos;re making a sticker from a clean photo of one person or your pet
          against a simple background, iOS&apos;s built-in cutout is fast and free. Use it. The point
          of MemePouch isn&apos;t to replace that — it&apos;s to give you a path for the cases the
          built-in tool can&apos;t handle: memes, screenshots, multi-subject reactions, anything with
          text or UI in it, and animated content.

              iOS&apos;s subject-extraction model picks one foreground region. On a clean photo it

              or a busy background, it clips the wrong region. There&apos;s no way to turn the cutout
