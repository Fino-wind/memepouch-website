          How to save stickers to your camera roll on iPhone
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8">Last updated 2026-06-10 · iOS 16+</p>

        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The fastest answer: <strong>screenshot it</strong>. Whatever app the sticker lives in —
          a TikTok comment, an iMessage chat, a web page — a screenshot captures it. Swipe the
          thumbnail away and the sticker is in your camera roll. That&apos;s the whole trick, and it
          works for literally any static sticker on any screen.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          But here&apos;s the thing most guides skip: <strong>you probably don&apos;t want stickers
          in your camera roll at all.</strong> You want them in your iMessage keyboard, ready to
          send — without your photo library turning into a junk drawer of memes. iOS has a
          little-known flow for exactly that, and it takes ten seconds.

          Route 1: screenshot → camera roll (the literal answer)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Take the screenshot (side button + volume up). A thumbnail floats in the bottom-left
          corner. Do nothing — swipe it away or just wait — and iOS saves it to your camera roll
          automatically. Crop it in Photos if you want just the sticker.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That answers the question, but it has two problems: every saved meme pollutes your photo
          library forever, and the sticker still isn&apos;t anywhere useful — it&apos;s a photo, not
          something you can send from your iMessage keyboard.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Route 2: screenshot → MemePouch → delete (camera roll never touched)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Few people know this: <strong>a fresh screenshot is not in your camera roll yet.</strong>{" "}
          While it sits in that bottom-left thumbnail, it lives in a temporary holding state — and
          iOS lets you share it and then throw it away without ever saving it:
        </p>
        <ol className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Screenshot the sticker</strong>, then tap the thumbnail in the bottom-left
            corner to open the preview.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tap the <strong>Share button in the top-right corner</strong> and choose{" "}
            <strong>MemePouch</strong>. The sticker is imported on the spot — you never leave the
            app you were in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tap <strong>Done</strong>. iOS asks what to do with the screenshot — choose{" "}
            <strong>Delete Screenshot</strong>. It never lands in Photos.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open any iMessage chat → MemePouch icon in the app drawer → your sticker is there.
            Tap to send, or drag it onto a message bubble.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Result: the sticker lives where stickers belong — your iMessage keyboard — and your
          camera roll stays photos of your actual life. If some memes have already piled up in
          Photos from the old way, MemePouch&apos;s{" "}
