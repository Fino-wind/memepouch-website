          You long-press a sticker your friend sent. iOS shows you the Emoji Details view. The
          familiar Save to Stickers button is right there. You tap it. Nothing happens. The view
          stalls. Sometimes you can dismiss it. Sometimes you can&apos;t. The sticker never
          lands in your iOS Stickers drawer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
          This isn&apos;t a missing button. It&apos;s a <strong>broken backend</strong>. Here&apos;s
          what&apos;s actually going on inside iOS, why Apple hasn&apos;t fixed it, and the one
          workaround that actually saves the sticker.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          What happens when you tap Save to Stickers
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When you tap Save to Stickers on a third-party sticker, iOS launches an internal Apple
          extension called{" "}
          <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">StickersUltraExtension</code>{" "}
          (full bundle id{" "}
          <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">com.apple.Stickers.UserGenerated.MessagesExtension</code>).
          This extension is Apple&apos;s in-house handler for &quot;user-generated&quot; stickers — the
          ones that don&apos;t come from a built-in sticker pack.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          StickersUltraExtension talks to the iOS sticker daemon —{" "}
          <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">stickersd</code> — over XPC
          (Apple&apos;s inter-process communication mechanism). For native Apple stickers (Photos
          cutouts, Memoji-style stickers), the conversation goes through cleanly and the sticker
          is written to the system stickers database.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For <strong>third-party</strong> stickers (anything created by an app using
          MSStickerBrowserView), the XPC peer connection between StickersUltraExtension and
          stickersd <strong>drops repeatedly</strong>. The save action stalls. The system never
          completes the write to the stickers database. The UI shows you the &quot;saving…&quot;
          state forever, until you force-quit Messages or wait for it to time out.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is the same pattern that&apos;s been reported by users on r/ios going back to
          iOS 17.0 — and as of iOS 18, it hasn&apos;t been fixed.

            The bundle id and XPC peer behavior above were derived from real-device system logs
            (iPhone tethered to a Mac, unified logs streamed during a tap on the Save to Stickers
            button on a third-party sticker). Apple has not published documentation of this
            failure mode; the description above is what the system itself reports in its own
            logs, not a guess at internals. If you reproduce different behavior on a newer iOS
            point release, please email{" "}

          Why third-party sticker apps can&apos;t fix this
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Sticker apps that ship through the App Store (LINE Stickers, Sticker Drop, MemePouch,
          and so on) talk to iMessage through the public{" "}
          <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">Messages</code> framework.
          That framework gives third-party apps three things:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>MSStickerBrowserView</strong> — a built-in sticker grid component the app
            shows in its iMessage extension. Users tap a sticker and it&apos;s inserted into the
            message field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MSConversation.insert</strong> / <strong>insertAttachment</strong> — programmatic
            ways to put a sticker or attachment into the input field from the extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>UIDropInteraction</strong> — the same drag-and-drop API used everywhere else
            in iOS. A sticker app can register its iMessage extension as a drop target for
            stickers dragged from the chat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The framework does <strong>not</strong> give third-party apps:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>Access to the iOS system Stickers database</li>
          <li>A way to register as a save destination for the Save to Stickers button</li>
          <li>Anything to do with the stickersd daemon or StickersUltraExtension</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Apple owns the entire save pipeline. The button you tap in Emoji Details, the XPC
          message to stickersd, the database where the sticker lands — all Apple-private. When
          that pipeline breaks, third-party apps can&apos;t even diagnose it from inside (the
          extension that hangs is Apple&apos;s, not yours).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          The drag-import workaround
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The one piece of API that third-party sticker apps <em>do</em> have for receiving
          stickers from a chat is <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded">
          UIDropInteraction</code>. If an app installs a drop target on its iMessage extension
          view, you can long-press a sticker in any chat and drag it onto that app&apos;s grid.
          The system delivers the sticker payload to the receiving app, which then saves it to
          its own library.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This is the workaround. It bypasses StickersUltraExtension and stickersd entirely —
          the sticker doesn&apos;t land in iOS&apos;s system Stickers drawer, but it lands in the
          third-party sticker app&apos;s library, and you can send it from there.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The full how-to is in{" "}
          <Link href="/blog/save-sticker-someone-sent-imessage" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
            the save-sticker guide
          </Link>{" "}
          — short version: long-press the sticker, drag onto an iMessage sticker app that
          supports drop import (two fingers if the app isn&apos;t open, one if it is), release on
          the grid.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Why most sticker apps don&apos;t support the drag
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          UIDropInteraction has been on iOS since iOS 11 (2017), but Apple only normalized
          dragging stickers out of chat bubbles in a later iOS release. Most sticker apps were
          shipped before that and never wired up a drop target. They&apos;ll happily show their
          stickers in iMessage but can&apos;t receive any. MemePouch is one of the few that
          explicitly does. You can tell by trying the drag — if the receiving app shows a green
          plus-sign while you hover, it&apos;ll accept the drop. If nothing happens, it
          won&apos;t.
        </p>
