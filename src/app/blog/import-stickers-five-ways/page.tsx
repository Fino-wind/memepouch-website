        5 ways to add a sticker to MemePouch
      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8 not-prose">Last updated 2026-05-20 · iOS 16+</p>

      <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Most sticker apps have one or two import paths. MemePouch ships <strong>five</strong>,
        because the meme you want to save lives in a different place every time —
        sometimes Photos, sometimes a Safari long-press, sometimes a sticker a friend just sent
        you in iMessage. This post walks through all five with concrete steps and what gets
        deduplicated.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        1. Photos picker — multi-select up to 30 at a time
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Tap <strong>Import from Photos</strong> on the home screen. The iOS PhotosPicker opens
        with multi-select on; pick up to 30 images or GIFs in any order. The selection order is
        preserved when they land in your library (so your &quot;reaction triplet&quot; stays in
        sequence). Each image goes through SHA-256 dedup — if a byte-identical copy already
        exists, the duplicate is silently skipped instead of cluttering your grid.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Two sibling buttons next to it handle video and Live Photo sources:{" "}
        <strong>Turn a video into a GIF</strong> and <strong>Turn a Live Photo into a GIF</strong>{" "}
        — both lead into the trim + Smart loop pipeline.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        2. Paste from Clipboard — one tap from anywhere
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Copy an image from any source: long-press in Safari, the share-preview &quot;Copy
        Photo&quot; in Photos, a screenshot&apos;s &quot;Copy&quot; quick action, &quot;Copy
        Image&quot; from a Discord or Twitter post, the share sheet&apos;s &quot;Copy&quot;
        action. Then tap <strong>Paste from Clipboard</strong> on MemePouch&apos;s home screen.
        The card validates that the clipboard actually has image content; if not, a friendly
        empty-state appears instead of a silent failure.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        Why this matters: it&apos;s the fastest path. No picker, no permissions prompt for an
        entire Photos library, no app switch. Just two taps total once the image is copied.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        3. iOS Share Sheet — from Safari, Twitter, WhatsApp, any app
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        MemePouch installs a Share Sheet extension. In any app with the standard iOS Share
        button — Safari, Twitter / X, Instagram, Mail, Files, WhatsApp, Photos, even other
        sticker apps — tap Share → MemePouch. The extension opens with a tiny progress modal
        (&quot;Processing 3/12…&quot;) so you can watch a batch land, and shows a green
        checkmark on success.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Video handoff (somewhat unusual):</strong> if you share a video instead of an
        image, MemePouch&apos;s share extension can&apos;t open the main app directly (Apple
        deliberately blocks share extensions from launching their host app). Instead, the
        extension writes the video into the App Group container as a handoff file and uses a
        responder-chain <code className="text-sm bg-slate-100 px-1 rounded">application.open</code>{" "}
        URL-scheme trick to nudge MemePouch into foreground — landing you straight in the trim
        view with the video ready. Most apps just throw a &quot;not supported&quot; error
        here.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        4. Drag and drop into the main app
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        On iPad with Stage Manager or Split View, or on iPhone with the multi-touch drag
        gesture, drag any image from Files, Safari, Photos, or another app onto the MemePouch
        home screen. A dashed-blue highlight appears confirming the drop target; release to
        import.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        This is the <strong>main-app</strong> drop target — different from the iMessage
        extension drop (next section). Use it when MemePouch is the foreground app and you
        want to drop something from another open window.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        5. Drag-import from iMessage — save stickers your friends sent you
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        This one&apos;s the headline feature: <em>save the sticker a friend sent you in
        iMessage</em>. iOS&apos;s built-in &quot;Save to Stickers&quot; button hangs on
        third-party stickers (Apple&apos;s system sticker daemon drops the XPC connection — see
        the{" "}

          deep-dive on why

        ), so MemePouch wires up a drop target inside its iMessage extension instead.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        The gesture: long-press the sticker your friend sent in the chat, keep your finger
        held down. With another finger, tap the MemePouch icon in the iMessage app drawer to
        open it. Drag the sticker into the MemePouch grid and release. The sticker imports,
        animation intact, ready to send back. Static stickers (PNG/JPEG) and animated GIFs
        both work — added in 1.8 after early reviewers had trouble with the two-finger gesture
        on static stickers.{" "}

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900 not-prose">
        What MemePouch can&apos;t import from
      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        One thing for honesty: MemePouch can&apos;t import directly from the iMessage sticker
        drawer itself (Apple&apos;s built-in stickers, Memoji, Animoji, system Live Stickers).
        Those live behind a private system surface that doesn&apos;t expose itself as a drop
        source or share destination. If you want one of Apple&apos;s system stickers in your
        MemePouch library, the workflow is: take a screenshot, crop it, and import via Path 1
        (PhotosPicker) — but at that point you might as well use Apple&apos;s system drawer
        directly.
