          where you actually chat. This article walks through what each category does well, what
          each gets wrong, and helps you pick. I&apos;ll be upfront: I built one of the apps

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          What it is: long-press the subject of any photo in iOS Photos. The system extracts what
          it thinks is the foreground and offers &quot;Add Sticker&quot;. The sticker lands in the
          iOS Stickers drawer and is available everywhere keyboards are, including iMessage.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>What it gets right:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

          <li>
            Auto-cutout decides for you. Meme caption text gets clipped. Multi-subject reactions

            way to disable.
          </li>
          <li>
            No animated stickers from arbitrary videos. iOS 17 added Live Stickers from Live
            Photos, but only one Live Photo at a time, with auto-cutout, and system-compressed
            for in-line use (Apple has not published the exact size cap for system Live Stickers).

          Category 2 — Cross-platform sticker makers
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          What they are: apps designed primarily for <strong>WhatsApp and Telegram sticker
          packs</strong>, with iMessage as a secondary export. The two most-installed examples
          have very different business models, so it&apos;s worth splitting them out:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Sticker.ly</strong> (by NAVER Z Corporation) — community-and-AI-first.
            Subscription-billed, with a trial that
            requires a card on file. The PLUS tier unlocks smart search, exclusive sticker
            packs, AI sticker / video / image generation, watermark removal, GIPHY library
            access, and iMessage sticker support. Built around a social feed with verified
            profiles and pack discovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sticker Maker Studio</strong> (by Tamara Vardanyan) — free, pack-creation
            utility. You name a pack first, add stickers to that pack, then push the pack to
            WhatsApp, iMessage, or other messengers. Includes background removal, photo / GIF /
            video conversion, and a community where users browse packs other people built.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>What both get right:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>Built-in subject cutout / background removal (Sticker.ly: PLUS tier; Sticker Maker Studio: free)</li>

          <li>Add text, frames, decorations, watermarks</li>
          <li>Community pack discovery — browse and download packs other users built</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Where they fall apart for iMessage-first users:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            UI optimized for WhatsApp / Telegram conventions, with pack-based ceremony (name
            a pack first) that feels heavy when you just want to drop one sticker into iMessage
          </li>
          <li>
            Saving stickers friends send you in iMessage isn&apos;t a documented feature in
            either app
          </li>
          <li>
            Community / social discovery is core to both — not always what you want if you
            just need a private sticker library
          </li>
          <li>
            iMessage attach-to-bubble support varies: Sticker.ly&apos;s PLUS page claims it;
            Sticker Maker Studio integrates by adding a pack to iMessage
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> WhatsApp / Telegram users who want a sticker pack to share
          with friends in those platforms. Pick Sticker.ly if you want the community + AI
          features and don&apos;t mind the subscription / card-on-file trial. Pick Sticker Maker
          Studio if you just want a free pack-creation utility and don&apos;t mind the
          pack-based workflow.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-slate-900">
          Category 3 — iMessage-native sticker apps
        </h2>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          What they are: apps designed specifically for iMessage. The sticker library lives in
          the iMessage app drawer, stickers attach to message bubbles like Apple&apos;s system
          stickers do, and they use Apple&apos;s native sticker APIs end-to-end. MemePouch is one
          of these. There are a few others, mostly older sticker pack apps that haven&apos;t kept
          up with iOS sticker drag-import.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>What they get right:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

          <li>
            <strong>Whole-image stickers, no auto-cutout.</strong> Import a photo, GIF, video, or
            Live Photo — the whole frame becomes a sticker. Good for memes where the caption or
            background context is the joke. (

          <li>
            <strong>Save stickers friends send you.</strong> MemePouch&apos;s iMessage extension
            registers as a drop target. Drag a sticker from any chat onto the MemePouch grid (two
            fingers if MemePouch isn&apos;t open, one finger if it is) — the sticker lands in
            your library with animation intact. (

          <li>
            <strong>Automatic duplicate detection.</strong> Import the same image twice — the
            second one is rejected with a notice instead of cluttering the library.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One-time unlock or subscription</strong> after the free tier — same
            app either way. No ads.

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>What MemePouch deliberately doesn&apos;t do:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>No cross-platform export</strong>. MemePouch is iMessage-only by design. If
            you primarily chat on WhatsApp or Telegram, Category 2 apps are a better fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No automatic background removal.</strong> Use Apple Photos&apos; long-press
            cutout (free) before importing if you want a transparent sticker. MemePouch&apos;s
            whole-image approach is intentional, not a missing feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No social discovery / shared pack store.</strong> Your library is private to
            your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No premium tier.</strong> The cheapest option unlocks the same app as the

              Apple&apos;s tool is free, fast, and auto-cuts the subject — great for selfies and
              pets, bad for memes with text or context. Third-party apps either replicate this
              with subscription (Category 2) or take a different approach (MemePouch keeps the
