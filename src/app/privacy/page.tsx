            Your privacy is critically important to us. MemePouch keeps your sticker library on your device and, if you leave iCloud sync switched on, in your own iCloud account — never on a server of ours, and never behind an account you have to create. We use only anonymous, aggregate usage analytics to understand how the app is used — never the content of your stickers and never anything that identifies you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">1. Local Data Storage</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            MemePouch processes and stores your imported stickers, photos, videos, and GIFs locally in the app&apos;s shared on-device container for the main app and iMessage extension.
            <strong> We do not maintain any servers of our own that store, sync, access, or analyze your media.</strong> Your memes and stickers remain private to you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">2. iCloud Sync (on by default)</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Since version 2.15, MemePouch can keep your sticker library in sync across your own
            devices using Apple&apos;s CloudKit, in the private database of <strong>your</strong> iCloud
            account. This is <strong>on by default</strong> and can be switched off at any time in the
            app&apos;s Settings.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            When it is on, your stickers are stored in your personal iCloud container — governed by
            Apple&apos;s privacy policy and your Apple ID, not by us. <strong>We cannot see, access, or
            recover that data</strong>, and it is never routed through any server we operate. When it is
            off, nothing leaves your device.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">3. Information Collection</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            MemePouch does not require an account and does not collect personal information or any data about the content of your stickers, photos, videos, or contacts. If you email support, we use the information you provide only to respond to your request.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">4. Anonymous Usage Analytics</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Starting with MemePouch version 2.0, the iOS app uses <a href="https://posthog.com/" className="text-pouch hover:text-pouch-deep font-medium">PostHog</a> to collect anonymous, aggregate product-usage analytics that help us understand how MemePouch is used and where to improve it. PostHog data is hosted in the European Union (<code>eu.i.posthog.com</code>) and processed in a GDPR-friendly manner.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            We only record high-level, non-identifying events such as:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>When the app is opened.</li>
            <li>Which features are used — for example importing, pinning, or sending a sticker.</li>
            <li>Whether you reach the in-app purchase screen (paywall).</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            These events are tied to an anonymous, app-generated device identifier. <strong>We never collect the content of your stickers, any personal data, or your contacts.</strong> This identifier is not linked to your identity and is not used to track you across other apps or websites. MemePouch does not use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA) and therefore does not show an App Tracking Transparency prompt, because it does not track you across apps or services owned by other companies.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">5. Device Permissions</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            MemePouch requests specific device permissions to function correctly:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> Required to let you import photos and videos to turn into stickers, and to optionally auto-delete imported media if you enable the clean-up feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> Required only when you explicitly tap the &quot;Paste from Clipboard&quot; button to import an image.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink mt-12 mb-4">6. Third-party Links</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Our app or website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.
          </p>
